# Disease-prediction
Prediction of diseases based on symptoms

To fit a model based on higher cross validation performance and save 

```
python3 main.py model -i  Path to csv file -o output path where model will be stored
```
To predict the model with gui- Change the path to input file in aux.predict
```
python3 main.py predict
```

Based upon fitting the model with multiple regressors and creating a dataset based on the symptoms occured during each disease the dataset creation is done.
